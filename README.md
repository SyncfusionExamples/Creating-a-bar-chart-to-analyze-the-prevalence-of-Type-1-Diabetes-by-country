# Creating a bar chart to analyze the prevalence of Type 1 Diabetes by country

A bar chart is used to display a distribution of data points or compare metric values across different subgroups of your data.

The [Cartesian Chart](https://www.syncfusion.com/maui-controls/maui-cartesian-charts) controls in .NET MAUI provide support for creating a transposed bar chart using a transposed column chart.

### Customization:

We can customize the appearance of the transposed column chart using properties such as [Fill](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/maui/Syncfusion.Maui.Charts.ChartSeries.html#Syncfusion_Maui_Charts_ChartSeries_Fill), [PaletteBrushes](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/maui/Syncfusion.Maui.Charts.SfCartesianChart.html#Syncfusion_Maui_Charts_SfCartesianChart_PaletteBrushes), [Stroke](
https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/maui/Syncfusion.Maui.Charts.ColumnSeries.html#Syncfusion_Maui_Charts_ColumnSeries_Stroke), and [StrokeWidth](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/maui/Syncfusion.Maui.Charts.XYDataSeries.html#Syncfusion_Maui_Charts_XYDataSeries_StrokeWidth).

### Plot area background view:

We can add any view to the plot area using the [PlotAreaBackgroundView](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/maui/Syncfusion.Maui.Charts.ChartBase.html#Syncfusion_Maui_Charts_ChartBase_PlotAreaBackgroundView) support, which is useful for adding relevant data.

In this example, we will compare the prevalence of type 1 diabetes in different countries using the .NET MAUI Cartesian Chart.

Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disease characterized by elevated levels of blood glucose, also known as blood sugar. This condition can cause serious damage to the heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys, and nerves over time. There are different types of diabetes. In people with type 1 diabetes, the immune system targets the insulin-producing islet cells of the pancreas, preventing the pancreas from producing insulin.

## Troubleshooting:

### Path too long exception:

If you encounter a path too long exception when building this example project, close Visual Studio and rename the repository to a shorter name before building the project. For a step-by-step procedure, refer to the [Type 1 Diabetes prevalence blog]().
